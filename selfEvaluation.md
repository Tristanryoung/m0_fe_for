# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

1. I think I need a lot of review and help with this. I will be going to office hours tomorrow for sure to hopefully review this assignment. I utilized a lot of online sources and although I completed it, I feel my understanding is lacking.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

2. I think I had a lot of productive struggle to be honest. Times like these are why I wanted to do this program in the first place... having some of those "aha" moments after hours of working is super fulfilling.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

3. I think I just need to do a bunch of practice problems... get exposed to different functions like toLowerCase etc...

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

4. I have some syntactical questions like why i goes in [] or why for the if statements there are multiple curly brackets. I will go to office hours tomorrow and hopefully review this entire assignent.
